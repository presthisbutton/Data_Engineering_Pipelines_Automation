# Gans Data Engineering and Data Pipelines Automation in the Cloud

## Introduction
E-scooter company Gans is interested in expanding into different European cities, especially the German speaking markets. In order to optimize its operation, the company needs to collect data that can help them determine the supply and demand for its scooters, and thus placing scooters at locations where the users need them.

## Description
Gans has discovered some user patterns as follows:

- In hilly cities, users tend to use scooters to go uphill and walk downhill
- E-scooter usage decreases drastically when there is rainfall
- Young tourists like to ride scooters from the airport to the city

Gans need to collect data such as geographical information and population, weather, airports and flight arrivals to the cities from external data sources, so that they can predict e-scooter movement. Certain data such as weather and flight arrivals have to be updated daily, therefore an automated data pipeline in the cloud is needed.
